CommonC

This project contains header files,
"data_structs.h", "debug_assert.h", "file_buffer.h", "get_random.h", "logger.h",
"permutation.h", and "xmath.h",
and will build an archive "commonc.a",
to support common functions while developing C programs.

Building and Installing:
You need the contents of the "include" folder
in your project's include directory, and link to the "commonc.a" archive.
The former comes with the source code,
and the latter will appear in the root of the source directory
after you run "make".

When compiled out of the box, the code is optimized,
and does not include debug information and output.
These settings can be changed in the "_CPPFLAGS" variable in "common.mk":
To add debug output, add "-D DEBUG".
To add debug information to the binary, add "-g".
"-O3" is the optimization flag, which you can remove or change.

In "common.mk" you can also change "CC" to any GCC-compatible compiler.


data_structs.c/h:
Currently, supports heap sort through the "heap_sort" function.


debug_assert.h:
"debug_assert" is a wrapper around "assert" to call it only if
the "DEBUG" macro is defined, eg. with the "-D DEBUG" command line option.
"debug_assert_imply" checks that an implication holds
only if "DEBUG" is defined.


file_buffer.c/h:
"file_buffer_t" is a wrapper around the "FILE *" file stream type for reading,
and can be accessed by functions similar to those used to read from "FILE *",
but up to a page of file data can be buffered in memory.


get_random.c/h:
"get_random" is a wrapper function to
fetch a specified number of random bytes from the operating system.


logger.c/h:
"printlg" prints messages to the stream specified by "LOG_FILE"
with the following logging levels,
sorted by decreasing priority:
"FATAL_LEVEL", "ERROR_LEVEL", "WARNING_LEVEL", "INFO_LEVEL",
"ASSERT_LEVEL",	"DEBUG_LEVEL".

The message is printed only if the given level is at least "DISP_LEVEL",
and when it is printed, the message starts with a tag representing its level.

The macros "LOG_FILE" and "DISP_LEVEL" can be redefined
before the line calling "printlg" in which the changes are to take effect.
By default, "LOG_FILE" is "stderr",
and "DISP_LEVEL" is "DEBUG_LEVEL" if "DEBUG" is defined,
or "INFO_LEVEL" otherwise.

The C code includes a function for converting raw binary data
into hexadecimal strings.


permutation.c/h:
"permute" generates an almost uniformly random permutation.


xmath.c/h:
Contains functions for calculating 128-bit products from 64-bit integers,
and 64-bit remainders from a 128-bit divident and a 64-bit divisor.
